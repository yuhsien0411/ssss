## Strategy Overview

**Important Notice**: Everyone must first understand the logic and risks of this script so you can set parameters that are more suitable for yourself, or you might think this is not a good strategy and don't want to use it at all. As I mentioned on Twitter, I didn't write these scripts for sharing purposes, but because I'm actually using this script myself, so I wrote it, and then shared it.
This script mainly focuses on long-term wear and tear. As long as the script continues to place orders, if the price reaches your highest trapped point after a month, then all your trading volume for that month will be zero-wear. Therefore, I believe that setting `--quantity` and `--wait-time` too small is not a good long-term strategy, but it is indeed suitable for short-term high-intensity volume trading. I usually use quantity between 40-60 and wait-time between 450-650 to ensure that even if the market goes against your judgment, the script can still place orders continuously and stably until the price returns to your entry point, achieving zero-wear volume trading.

The bot implements a simple trading strategy:

1. **Order Placement**: Places limit orders near the current market price
2. **Order Monitoring**: Waits for orders to be filled
3. **Close Order**: Automatically places close orders at the take-profit level
4. **Position Management**: Monitors positions and active orders
5. **Risk Management**: Limits maximum number of concurrent orders
6. **Grid Step Control**: Controls minimum price distance between new orders and existing close orders via `--grid-step` parameter
7. **Stop Trading Control**: Controls the price conditions for stopping transactions through the `--stop-price` parameter

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Parameters

- **quantity**: Trading amount per order
- **take-profit**: Take-profit percentage (e.g., 0.02 means 0.02%)
- **max-orders**: Maximum concurrent active orders (risk control)
- **wait-time**: Wait time between orders (prevents overtrading)
- **grid-step**: Grid step control (prevents close orders from being too dense)
- **stop-price**: When `direction` is 'buy', exit when price >= stop-price; 'sell' logic is opposite (default: -1, no price-based termination)
- **pause-price**: When `direction` is 'buy', pause when price >= pause-price; 'sell' logic is opposite (default: -1, no price-based pausing)

#### Grid Step Feature

The `--grid-step` parameter controls the minimum distance between new order close prices and existing close order prices:

- **Default -100**: No grid step restriction, executes original strategy
- **Positive value (e.g., 0.5)**: New order close price must maintain at least 0.5% distance from the nearest close order price
- **Purpose**: Prevents close orders from being too dense, improving fill probability and risk management

For example, when Long and `--grid-step 0.5`:

- If existing close order price is 2000 USDT
- New order close price must be lower than 1990 USDT (2000 √ó (1 - 0.5%))
- This prevents close orders from being too close together, improving overall strategy effectiveness

#### üìä Trading Flow Example

Assuming current ETH price is $2000 with take-profit set to 0.02%:

1. **Open Position**: Places buy order at $2000.40 (slightly above market price)
2. **Fill**: Order gets filled by the market, acquiring long position
3. **Close Position**: Immediately places sell order at $2000.80 (take-profit price)
4. **Complete**: Close order gets filled, earning 0.02% profit
5. **Repeat**: Continues to the next trading cycle

#### üõ°Ô∏è Risk Management

- **Order Limits**: Limits maximum concurrent orders via `max-orders`
- **Grid Control**: Ensures reasonable spacing between close orders via `grid-step`
- **Order Frequency Control**: Controls order timing via `wait-time` to prevent being trapped in short periods
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors positions and order status
- **‚ö†Ô∏è No Stop Loss**: This strategy does not include stop-loss functionality and may face significant losses in adverse market conditions

## üÜï Hedge Mode

The new Hedge Mode (`hedge_mode.py`) is an trading strategy that reduces risk by simultaneously hedging trades across two exchanges:

### How Hedge Mode Works

1. **Opening Phase**: Place maker order at selected exchange (e.g., Backpack)
2. **Hedging Phase**: After order fills, immediately place market order at Lighter to hedge
3. **Closing Phase**: Place another maker order at selected exchange to close position
4. **Hedge Closing**: Place market order at Lighter to close hedge position

### Hedge Mode Usage Examples

```bash
# Run BTC hedge mode with Backpack
python hedge_mode.py --exchange backpack --ticker BTC --size 0.05 --iter 20

# Run ETH hedge mode with Extended
python hedge_mode.py --exchange extended --ticker ETH --size 0.1 --iter 20

# Run BTC hedge mode with Apex
python hedge_mode.py --exchange apex --ticker BTC --size 0.05 --iter 20

# Run BTC hedge mode with GRVT
python hedge_mode.py --exchange grvt --ticker BTC --size 0.05 --iter 20
```

   ```

2. Open this URL in your browser

3. Search for "account_index" in the results - if you have subaccounts, there will be multiple account_index values. The shorter one is your main account, and the longer ones are your subaccounts.

### Command Line Arguments

- `--exchange`: Exchange to use: 'edgex', 'backpack', 'paradex', 'aster', 'lighter', 'grvt', or 'extended' (default: edgex)
- `--ticker`: Base asset symbol (e.g., ETH, BTC, SOL). Contract ID is auto-resolved.

- `--stop-price`: When `direction` is 'buy', stop trading and exit the program when price >= stop-price; 'sell' logic is opposite (default: -1, no price-based termination). The purpose of this parameter is to prevent orders from being placed at "high points for long positions or low points for short positions that you consider".
- `--pause-price`: When `direction` is 'buy', pause trading when price >= pause-price and resume trading when price falls back below pause-price; 'sell' logic is opposite (default: -1, no price-based pausing). The purpose of this parameter is to prevent orders from being placed at "high points for long positions or low points for short positions that you consider".
- `--boost`: Enable Boost mode for volume boosting on Aster and Backpack exchanges (only available for 'aster' and 'backpack')
  Boost trading logic: Place maker orders to open positions, immediately close with taker orders after fill, repeat this cycle. Wear consists of one maker order, one taker order fees, and slippage.

## Q & A

### How to configure multiple accounts for the same exchange on the same device?

1. Create a .env file for each account, such as account_1.env, account_2.env
2. Set `ACCOUNT_NAME=` in each account's .env file, such as `ACCOUNT_NAME=MAIN`.
3. Configure the API keys or secrets for each account in each file
4. Use different `--env-file` parameters in the command line to start different accounts, such as `python runbot.py --env-file account_1.env [other parameters...]`

### How to configure multiple accounts for different exchanges on the same device?

Configure all different exchange accounts in the same `.env` file, then use different `--exchange` parameters in the command line to start different exchanges, such as `python runbot.py --exchange backpack [other parameters...]`

### How to configure multiple contracts for the same account and exchange on the same device?

Configure the account in the `.env` file, then use different `--ticker` parameters in the command line to start different contracts, such as `python runbot.py --ticker ETH [other parameters...]`
